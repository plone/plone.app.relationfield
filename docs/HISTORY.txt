  [optilude]

1.0b3 (2009-09-27)
------------------

- Fix IObjectPath utility's resolve() method signature. Thanks Hedley Roos.
  [optilude]

1.0b2 (2009-07-18)
------------------

- Add IObjectPath utility. This is required for broken relationships to work.
  Without it, deleting an object that has inbound relations will cause an
  error. Arguably, this isn't the ideal package for this, somewhat more
  general utility, but it can always be moved later as it's not imported
  anywhere.

- Made Archetypes support truly optional.
  [hannosch]

- Create glue package for adding z3c.relationfield support to Plone/Dexterity.
